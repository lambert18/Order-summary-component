## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties

### What I learned

My first time using border to make a button without tag button.

```css
.btn {
  font-weight: 700;
  position: relative;
  width: 300px;
  height: auto;
  padding: 15px;
  margin: 0 auto;
  background-color: var(--bright_blue);
  color: white;
  border-radius: 10px;
  cursor: pointer;
  box-shadow: 0 12px 40px hsla(245, 75%, 52%, 0.4);
}
```

### Continued development

In the future I will make improvements to the CSS part, because I only use the simplest Properties and it's still very messy, so I need to learn more and continue this development again.
